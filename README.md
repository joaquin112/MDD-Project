MDD-Project
===========

Welcome to my MDD project Github page. I hope to turn this project into a full application that will hopefully have many users one day. 

Positive Thoughts is a social website with the aim to share as many positive images/thought as possible. The website will feature Facebook integration to maximize the possibility of images going viral. Additionally, it will include a good user login/registration interface which will encourage user loyalty.
