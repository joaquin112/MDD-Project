MDD-Project
===========

Welcome to my MDD project Github page. I hope to turn this project into a full application that will hopefully have many users one day. 

Positive Thoughts is a social website with the aim to share as many positive images/thought as possible. The website will feature Facebook integration to maximize the possibility of images going viral. Additionally, it will include a good user login/registration interface which will encourage user loyalty.

Important files:

[Main Controller](https://github.com/joaquin112/MDD-Project/blob/master/application/controllers/main.php)

[Homepage model](https://github.com/joaquin112/MDD-Project/blob/master/application/models/pages/homepage.php)

[Views folder](https://github.com/joaquin112/MDD-Project/tree/master/application/views)

[Forms folder](https://github.com/joaquin112/MDD-Project/tree/master/application/controllers/forms)


To install the application on your local MAMP:

Download all the files.

Upload to your htdocs folder.

Use the file located in the assets (the latest MySQL dump)

Then just access http://localhost:8888/ 

And you will be able to use the website as I intended.
